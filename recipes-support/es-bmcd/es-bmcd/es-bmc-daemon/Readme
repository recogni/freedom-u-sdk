First, please ensure that your GCC toolchain and its sysroot are working correctly.For example, use the following command to set an environment variable
	export PATH= your gcc dir/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-toolsuite-13.0.0-2021.11.5-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/bin:$PATH
	export SYSROOT= your gcc dir/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-toolsuite-13.0.0-2021.11.5-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/sysroot

Then, As an example, compile using the following command
	make CC=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc

Finally, please place the es-bmcd in usr/bin/ directory
            place S60es-bmcd file in the /etc/init.d/ directory to ensure the daemon program starts automatically
